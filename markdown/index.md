## Welcome

This content is rendered from the Markdown in `markdown/index.md` file. Modify it and refresh to see
changes.

### Adding new Pages

Add new folders with Markdown files in the `markdown` directory and navigate to them to
automatically create new pages. For example, the `markdown/pages/about.md` file is loaded by
visiting
[/pages/about](/pages/about).

### PHP, Bootstrap 5, Twig

A starter Bootstrap 5 template is provided in `templates/base.html.twig`. Modify it to change header
and footer elements. Also check out the `templates/core/error.html.twig` and `not-found.html.twig`
templates to customize 500 and 404 error pages.

You can extend the framework functionality by adding new PHP controllers. Check
out [johnsquibb/php-microframework](https://github.com/johnsquibb/php-microframework) to learn more
about using the framework that powers Markdown Website.

### Cached HTML

After loading this page the cache directory should contain an `index.html` file with the full cache
of this content, including header and footer. Relative links are automatically replaced with .html
suffixes for connecting up all the pages.

See the project README.md for instructions on how to view the cached HTML content.
